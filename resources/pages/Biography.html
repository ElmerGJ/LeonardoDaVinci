            <h1>Leonardo da Vinci Biography</h1>
            <img class="img_left" src="../../resources/img/self-portrait.jpg" alt="Leonardo Da Vinci self portrait">
            <p class="introduction">
                <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> was a prominent name not only during the Italian Renaissance, but is
                still recognized as one of the most well-known names in the art world today. He was a prominent figure,
                intellectual, and one of the leading artists that made a name for themselves during the Renaissance. Not
                only is he known for some of the most famous pieces to come out of this period in the art world, but
                throughout any period of time in art history. Of course, The Last Supper, and The Mona Lisa, are a couple
                of his most famous pieces, but Leonardo da Vinci also worked on a series of other works during his career,
                and crafted plenty of pieces which have withstood the test of time, and are still considered masterpieces
                to this day. <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p class="style_normal">
                Born in 1452 in Vinci, Italy, Leonardo da Vinci focused on the laws of sciences and nature early in his
                life. This respect and knowledge allowed him to depict these things in his artwork. They not only helped
                inform him as a painter, but also as a sculptor, draftsmen, and an inventor. Not only have his works become
                some of the most well known in the art world, but they also served as inspiration to many other artists
                during his time, and still to this day. Further, they made him a prominent figure during the Renaissance
                period, for his forward-thinking, and distinct view on images he created during the period. <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Young Career</h2>
            <p class="style_normal">
                At the age of 14 Leonardo da Vinci worked as an apprentice to Verrocchio. During this six-year period he
                learned several techniques and technical skills. This included in metal working, working with leather, the
                arts, carving, sculpting, and of course drawing and painting. By the age of 20 he had become a master
                craftsman of the guild, and had opened his own studio at this young age. For a couple of years he remained
                out of the public eye, following the period where he was charged with and acquitted of having committed
                sodomy. Up until about the age of 22, he really did not focus much on his works. <br>
            </p>
    
            <h2>The Last Supper</h2>
            <p class="style_normal">
                Lorenzo de Medici commissioned Leonardo da Vinci in 1482, to create a piece for the Duke of Monaco, which
                was being done as a gesture of peace. In addition to creating the piece, he wrote a letter explaining how
                he would be the perfect painter, and how he could work for the court. After the piece and his letter were
                accepted, Leonardo da Vinci was commissioned to work from 1482 up until 1499 by the court. Although he
                worked on many individual pieces during this time, a few which did become famous pieces, it was also during
                this time when he crafted one of his most well-known pieces,
                <a href="Masterpieces/TheLastSuper.html">The Last Supper</a>. <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Mona Lisa</h2>
            <p class="style_normal">
                Between 1505 to 1507 Leonardo da Vinci was commissioned for private work. It was during this period that
                he not only created his most famous piece of artwork, but also possibly one of the most well known, and
                the most famous pieces of artwork which has ever been crafted in the world,
                <a href="Masterpieces/TheMonaLisa.html">The Mona Lisa</a>. There were many theories and stories behind this
                piece. Some included that she had jaundiced, many thought it was a piece of a pregnant woman, and others
                claim it is not a woman at all, but a man dressed in drag. Although no accounts are proven, there are many
                theories surrounding this piece, and this is what gives it so much allure. <br>
    
                The Mona Lisa was also a constant work in progress for Leonardo da Vinci; it was a piece he never quite
                finished, and was always trying to perfect. The painting itself was never given to the commissioner who
                had hired him for the work, and was kept with him until his death. It is currently in the Louvre in Paris,
                and is protected by the thickest bulletproof glass. It is not only considered to be a national treasure,
                it is also considered the most famous art piece to have been created, by any artist, during any period or
                form of art. <br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>More than an Artist</h2>
            <p class="style_normal">
                Leonardo da Vinci was said to be a Renaissance man, who had far more to offer to the world during his
                period than just art. His talents were noted to greatly exceed the arts of work that he created during his
                career. He did not create a divide between science and art, like many humanists of the time, which is what
                gave his work such depth, and so much character. Over 13,000 pages of notes documented his inventions,
                creations, observations, and drawings. Architecture and anatomy, designs for flying machines, plant studies,
                and other work he was involved in, were all documented in these pages. <br>
    
                Most of his ideas were theoretical and very rarely if ever experimental. He was also known to have been
                one of the first to document the human body in the form of a child, as he stayed as close as possible to
                the actual anatomy, and did not drift away from the sciences in his works. One of the last commissioned
                works that he created during his career was a mechanical lion. It could walk, and open its chest, which
                revealed a bouquet of lilies. He died soon after in 1519. <br>

            <p class="style_normal">
                Not only was Leonardo da Vinci one of the most influential figures during his time, but he was a leading
                Renaissance man. He was well ahead of his time, and he was more than just an artist. He was a great thinker,
                and he developed a series of great works and inventions during the course of his career. Although he did
                have a few issues early in his career, he moved past these and became one of the most well-known artists
                throughout history. Still to this day, his works remain some of the most famous throughout history, and
                still influence young artists working during this period in the art world. <br>
